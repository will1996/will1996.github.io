					<h1>Bio:</h1>
					<p> I grew up in the Rocky Mountains, outside Boulder Colorado.<br />
						 I've lived in the DC/Baltimore Area for almost 8 years now<br/>
						 My two homes have given me a deep love for the outdoors<br/>
						 Games are cooler though.

						<h1>Favorite Games:</h1>
					<p> <h1>All Time:</h1> Three way tie between Dark Souls 1 , Okami, Getting Over It 
						</p>
					<p> <h1>Right Now:</h1> Horizon Forbidden west. <small>Even better than the original</small>

							<h2> I want to use Generative AI, and Deep Learning to make better games, faster. </h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							I set out to be a physics researcher, I started writing machine learning algorithms in a condensed matter physics lab, but it was my love of video games 
							that inspired me to get a computer science degree. During my time in physics I was always trying to make physics engines, or little asteroids clones. 
							Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would end up as Lead AI Programmer at Oxide Games. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I got a minor in computer science along with my first bachelors, that and my extensive math background got me a job writing Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
							algorithms. It was a great first job which got me started in paralell C++, SIMD, as well as the iterative process of making useful GUI and python interfaces for 
							other teams. I knew I wanted to make games, though. So I started writing an engine myself, I made a lot of progress,
							but quickly realized that I needed a lot more education if I was going to know everything I needed to. 
							I reenrolled in my Bachelors while working full time, then on to my masters. <br/>
						</p>
						<p>
							Between my job, course work on classical AI and deep learning, and my game engine projects I learned fast, after two years I applied to oxide games, 
							passed all the interviews, and got the job!
						</p>
						<p>
							Working at Oxide has been tough, the deadlines are fast, and the problems are really hard, but it's better than I could have imagined.
							 I earned the trust of the team fast, that trust has built a truly collaborative environment 
							where amazing things happen every day. I love Oxide and I couldn't be more proud of how our game is shaping up!
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside work I am seeking to make games differently, my experience at Oxide has shown me the challenges of making games on strict timelines;
							my research is focused on adressing those challenges with the latest in generative AI.
